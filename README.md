# Zeal: Complaint Detection Software

## Description

This project was developed for Headstarter AI's online hackathon, where our team was tasked with creating an innovative software solution for businesses. We built Zeal, an AI-powered complaint detection service, which included a comprehensive dashboard and a multi-modal AI agent capable of processing text, audio, and images. Although we aimed to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), time constraints prevented us from fully integrating it.

Our project placed in the top 5 out of over 120 teams, earning recognition for its well-rounded execution and functionality.
